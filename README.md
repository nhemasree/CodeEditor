This project is a lightweight Python Code Editor built using the Tkinter library. It allows users to write, edit, save, and execute Python code within a simple and intuitive graphical interface. The editor provides an integrated output console, multiple file-handling options, and theme customization for a better coding experience.

* Features

Create, Open, Save, and Save As Python files.

Run Python code directly within the editor (displays output and errors).

Light and Dark themes for comfortable coding.

Font size adjustment with keyboard shortcuts.

Integrated output console for viewing results.

Keyboard shortcuts for fast operations (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+N, Ctrl+O, etc.).

* Technologies Used

Language: Python

GUI Library: Tkinter

Modules Used: os, subprocess, filedialog, messagebox

* How It Works

The user writes or opens a .py file inside the text area.

On clicking Run, the code is saved temporarily and executed using the subprocess module.

The output and errors are displayed in the output section below the editor.

Files can be saved, reopened, or created anew easily through the menu options.

The theme toggle allows switching between light and dark modes dynamically.

* Why This Project

This editor demonstrates how to combine Python GUI programming and file handling to create a practical, beginner-friendly IDE-like environment. Itâ€™s perfect for learning Tkinter, subprocess handling, and event-driven programming in Python.

* Future Enhancements

Syntax highlighting for Python keywords.

Line numbering and auto-indentation.

Code suggestion and autocomplete.
